Topic: A list of names that convert their letters to uppercase
Data: List of names/its function/and an arbitrary variable
Relationship between data and unknown: Using map, we convert it to uppercase
Solution:
First of all, we define a list of names
Then we define a function and give it an arbitrary name and also define a variable
And we return that variable
After that, we define a variable and use list, map and string, we operate on it
And we print it
