 writing a program whose database is a dictionary with three members, and if it is duplicate, it is not allowed to enter.
We consider a tuple for three members and use a list to store them 
Dictionary can be the name , family,business and we bet not to repeat it and at the end we will show them all together.

Dictionary can be name, occupation and surname 
 We bet it won't do if it's out of the dictionary
